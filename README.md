# 3D-graph-plotter
<p>It is a graph plotting application for for desktop.It is made completely in python.</p>
<p>It can work as a nice project for python training.</p> 

To enter any mathematical function we need to use specific type such as below:
<p>** for ^ or power operation</p>
<p>* for multiplication</p>
<p>/ for divion</p>

<p>+ for addition</p>

<p>- for substraction</p>
I suggest usage of braces for large expressions.
